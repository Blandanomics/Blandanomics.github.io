<h4>What You'll Learn</h4>
<li>Exact language to use in your email pitch to ensure you get coverage.</li>
<li>A two-step formula for nailing any press interview.</li>
<li>More than just "tips" but long-term strategies for building relationships with the press.</li>
<li>The 10-step checklist to ensure your credibility is established when the media sees your product.</li>
<li>A journalist's most common reservations when covering a startup, and how you can squash them.</li>
<li>How to play the long term game and outgrow the need for any media coverage.</li> 
<li>...and much more</li>

<p>This ebook doesn't contain any unnecessary fluff, just the actionable information that you need today. Learn from the hundreds of startups, journalists, and entrepreneurs I've talked to in my career and change the way you push new products for the rest of your startup's life.</p>

<h4>Hit the Ground Running</h4>
<p>Even smaller PR firms can charge around $3,000 a month (not to mention costly retainers for larger launches). For a fraction of that, you can do it yourself and put your money where it belongs: into your product. Hacking PR gives you a crash course in crafting your own relationships with the press by building authentic long-lasting relationships and standing above the hundreds of pitches journalists get every day.</p>
