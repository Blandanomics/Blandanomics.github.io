Last year, a friend of mine who teaches high school mentioned in a Facebook status that all of his students kept using the phrase "on fleek" to describe anything and everything (though typically directed toward eyebrows).

I scoffed to myself and thought about how dumb that sounded and carried on. A few months later, every thing was "on fleek". [Brands were on fleek](https://twitter.com/brandonfleek). [_The New York Times_ was on fleek](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/22/upshot/internet-language-quiz.html). The phrase had permeated the culture. What I had dismissed as irrelevant a few months before was now the coolest thing in the world (for a while, before cycling right back to uncool again). I had become my father, and "on fleek" was an updated version of some stupid early aughts phrases I threw around. It was off the hook, yo.

Well, maybe not _my_ father. But _your_ father. Our fathers. Society's fathers. In other words: Somewhere along the line I became dismissive of the preferences of those younger than me. I swore I would never be that close-minded adult. But there I was. I had become Darth Vader.

Like Social Security and pensions, ignoring the habits and preferences of people younger than ourselves is a luxury that will end with Generation X. Especially those of us in the media/culture/internet business. 20 years ago you could probably coast along and safely disregard trends and still have your job security in tact. No one is saying we late-20-somethings need to run around saying "on fleek", but each generation brings with it a larger digital audience. We ignore them at our peril.

Demographics say that we Millennials are having children later than our parents. This means we have a longer period of our lives where we associate with no children to tie us back to youth culture. So download Minecraft and play around. Subscribe to a few of the YouTube stars. Poke around YikYak. Walk in the footsteps of those younger than you, no matter no foreign their habits may seem.

After all, there's some older Baby Boomer who thinks the Internet is a giant waste of time and all of younger folks are just fools. Don't be that guy. You promised you wouldn't, remember?
