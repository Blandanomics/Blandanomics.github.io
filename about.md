Hi! I'm Sean Blanda. And while I always struggle to give my elevator pitch, I like to think I build editorial products that serve communities.

Current focus: Running <a href="http://99u.com">99U</a>, the "think-tank" of Behance. 99U's yearly conference, quarterly magazine, and website that are all dedicated to empowering the creative community. There, I <a href="/speaking/">speak</a> and write mostly about the <a href="http://99u.com/articles/19565/a-troublemakers-manifesto-the-benefits-of-wandering">future of the career </a> and profile serial idea executors like <a href="http://99u.com/articles/50697/bevels-tristan-walker-the-best-ideas-are-brewed-out-of-authenticity">Tristan Walker</a> and <a href="http://99u.com/articles/30561/fred-seibert-never-compete-in-the-scrum">Fred Seibert</a>.

My posts here are an attempt to chronicle what I'm learning along the way, with the occasional diversion or two.

I was born in South Jersey, lived in Philadelphia for seven years, and have resided in New York City since late 2012. I care way too much about Philadelphia sports, drink way too much Coca-Cola, and eat way too much Mexican food. Independence is the best holiday and Will Smith movie, <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZPEUyiNcjA">Hotel Yorba by The White Stripes</a> is the best song ever made, the state of Colorado has the best flag.

<h3>Other projects</h3>
- I'm also one of the co-founders of <a href="http://technical.ly">Technical.ly</a>, a network of local tech news sites based out of Philadelphia.
- I'm the founder of BarCamp NewsInnovation (BCNI) a journalism-focused unconference that takes place yearly in Philadelphia.
- I wrote <a href="/hackingpr">Hacking PR</a>, a small ebook to help bootstrapped entrepreneurs pitch the media.
